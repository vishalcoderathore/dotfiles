   brew update && brew upgrade

- To upgrade a specific package:
   ```sh
    brew upgrade <package-name>

- To check if any packages are outdated:
   ```sh
    brew outdated

## üõ† Managing Dotfiles with GNU Stow
I use GNU Stow to manage my configuration files in a structured way.

### üìå Structure
I then use stow to create symlinks for specific applications:
```
stow lazydocker
stow yarn
stow yazi
stow kitty
```
This automatically symlinks the configurations from ~/.dotfiles/ into the corresponding locations inside ~/.config/.

## üî• Removing a Dotfile Symlink
If I want to remove a dotfile symlink:
```sh
  stow -D <package>
```

## ü¶ä Installing & Managing Firefox Developer Edition
Firefox Developer Edition is not available in most package managers or app stores, so I manually downloaded and installed it.
### üì• Installation Process

1. **Download the latest Firefox Developer Edition tarball from the official website**:
   ```sh
   wget -O /opt/firefox-developer.tar.bz2 "https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-devedition-latest-ssl&os=linux64&lang=en-US"
2. **Extract the tarball into /opt/:**
   ```sh
    sudo tar -xjf /opt/firefox-developer.tar.bz2 -C /opt/
3. **Rename the extracted folder (if needed) for consistency:**
   ```sh
    sudo mv /opt/firefox /opt/firefox-developer
4. **Create a symlink in /usr/local/bin/ for easy execution:**
   ```sh
    sudo ln -sf /opt/firefox-developer/firefox /usr/local/bin/firefox-developer
5. **Launch Firefox Developer Edition**:
   ```sh
    firefox-developer

### ‚ùå Uninstalling Firefox Developer Edition
- To completely remove Firefox Developer Edition from my system:
   ```sh
  sudo rm -rf /opt/firefox-developer
  sudo rm -f /opt/firefox-developer.tar.bz2
  sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/firefox-developer
